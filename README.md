# Neural-Network-Project-using-MNIST-data-set
# This Neural gets around a 90-95% accuracy depending on what configuration of layers you use in the Neural Network. I find that the NN works best for 3 layers without #too many Nodes in each layer. 
#The last 2 lines of code call the function which runs the program. If you would like to play with different configurations, just change these. A configuration is #already given to see the NN train on the data set. So if you copy and paste the code, all you have to do is click run to see it work and in action.
